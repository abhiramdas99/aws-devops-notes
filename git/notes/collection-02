 THE CODE BELOW IS EXPLAINING HOW TO START YOUR 1ST PROJECT
 BY "GIT INIT" IN DEVELOPER MACHINS
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# mkdir myapp  // create your project
# cd myapp // navigate to that folder  
# git init // initialize the git by this command 
# ll -al   //to see all the hiden folder . Means now can able to see a .git folder. Means git is successfully initialized 
  note that by default the master branch will be created when you initialized te project in local machine
  
Lets create a file i.e index.html in this directory-
# echo "its my 1st testing file" > index.html

 Note  that, there are 4 logical area in git . You can also say that, its a git architecture .
 1) working area / unstaging area  2) staging area  3) local repository 4) remote repository 

Lets run the following below command , 
# git status  // this command will return  one thing, either  "untrack file lsit " or "upto date" message 

Lets activate the tracking on this file 
# git add .  //you can add the specific filename in the place of dot  . Dot means all files and  folders will be add to track
             //now the file index.html in staging area 
 
Topic: Lets commit above changes 
----------------------------------------------
 COMMAND:
  # git commit -m "my 1st commit" 
 IMPORTANT NOTES:
  -> on run this command git will commit the update to local repository
  -> it return commit-id with 7 alphanumeric digit , number of new line insertion in files
  -> if you not set your identity, it will prompt  you to set it first 
 QUESTION & ANSWER: 
  Q1) Can we directly commit without add the changes done previously ? 
  A1) Yes, but you need to combinely invoke the command 
   # git commit -a -m " my combine commad to directly add and commit " 
  


Lets set  your identity 
# git config --global user.name abhiramdas99 // its best, if you create a git account in git hub and provide name accordngly
# git config --global user.email abhiramdas99@gmail.com //its best , if you give that email id as per your git hub account 

Lets check the git logs
# git log
 -> it rerun the log with - commit head and pointing to  branch like master for our case 
 -> to see the log in single line you can use the folloing command 
 # git log -oneline 
 
 
Lets you have done many alteration and deletion the content within the files, how you indentifing the change ? 
#git diff   // it show differentiate of previous content and new content  for all files 
#git diff <filename> its show the changes of contents 
-> note that, git diff command is working only in working-directory, once move to staging area, its not show the difference 

Lets restore the the last changes of one my files
#git checkout -- index.html 
--> discard the last changes
-> this command is only work in working directory ,if there is some difference in conent
   means once move to staging area , we cant restore the previous changes in this way 
--> remember once this command you cant revert back 

Now suppose we have done the changes and move the file from working directory to staging area,
then how can i find the changes in staging area?
# git diff --staged index.html 
--> It will show the difference only for staging area 


---------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC : REVERT BACK FROM STAGING AEA TO WORKING DIRECTORY 
---------------------------------------------------------
 Now suppose,I want to back everything from staging area to working directory,
 then can i do that ? 
 COMMAND :
   # git reset HEAD index.html 
   # git checkout -- index.html 
 NOTES:
   -> The 1st command is reset the head, means bring the thing to working directory 
   -> The 2nd command is reset the contents within the file in working directory 
 QUESTION AND ANSWER:
  Q1) suppose you have done  5 commit, now your head  is pointing to latest commit id, means 5th number 
      But you wan to remove all the commit after 2 commit and want to move the header pointer to 2nd commit ?
      # git reset --soft <2nd number commit id)  // this command reset everything back to the staging area 
      # git reset --mixed <2nd number commit id  // this command reset everything  back to the working directory 
      Means you need to add  and re-comit the latest update again to staging area then local repo
      # git reset --hard <2nd number commit id>  // this command  reset upto given commit id in all stage 
      
      
---------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC : REVERT BACK IN LOCAL REPO
---------------------------------------------------------------
 Suppose you have  commited to the local repo by mistake and you want revert back 
 COMMAND :
   # git log --oneline  
   # git revert xfxdfdfd 
 NOTES:
   -> The 1st command is retrive the log history  and copy the commit id 
   -> The 2nd command is revert back to workikng directory  based on comit id 
   -> Remember it can't revert to working directory, it just rever back within 
      remote repo

---------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC : CHECK THE FILES ARE COMMITED TO LOCAL REPO
---------------------------------------------------------------
# git ls-files //it will only show the commited file to local repo

---------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC : CHECK COMPLETE HISTORY AS PER COMMIT ID 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose you have done many commit and you want some more detail on one partical commit 
 COMMAND :
   # git show <commit-id>
 NOTES:
   -> It will show all the activities that done the p
   -> The 2nd command is revert back to workikng directory  based on comit id 
       
    
---------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC : CONCEPT OF RM AND HOW IT WORK
---------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose  you have done the commited a file wrongly ,you dont want that file in 
local repository 
COMMAND :
 # rm --cached <filenname> // this command completely delete the file in local repo
 

---------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC : ABOUT BRANCHES(BASIC)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Suppose you are working for ecommerce project and it consist of many modules sub modules 
and different type of environment like  dev, QA, production, then how can  you manage all 
these thing. Then concept is came here , called branch. For above examaple I can create 
dev-login, dev-dashboard, dev-account , env-dev, env-qa, env-prod

---------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC : BASIC WORK WITH BRANCH
---------------------------------------------------------------
# git branch // this command show the default branch name where are working 
             // the *<master>, the star means you are in default branch
# git branch <dev-login> 
             // it careate new branch name (copy of master branch)
# git checkout <dev-login> 
             // switch to your new branh
             // also it make the new branch as default branch
 # git checkout -b <new-branch-name> 
             // it create new branch as well as checkout to new branh            
 $ git merge de-login master  
             // this command merge the files from current branch to master branch 
 $ git branch -D  dev-login 
             // remember 1st you need to checkout the branches which you want to delete
             

---------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC : BRANCH MERGE
---------------------------------------------------------------
1) Suppose  you are in feature branch and do some modifiacation in index.html , and you want to
   merge it to master branch the you can do it
   # git checkout master  //1st you need to checkout to master branch 
   # git merge feature-branch master  // this command merge every thing from feature-branch 
  to master branch 
2) suppose you are in feature branch and done many commit, now you want to only one specific commit t be 
   merge to master branch, then you can  you do it ?
   # git cherry-pick commited <commmit-id>
   
  
  
---------------------------------------------------------------
TOPIC : NORMAL COMMIT VS MERGE VS REBASE 
---------------------------------------------------------------
You can understand the exact different in following explaination 
  step 1: 
    master =  C1----C2---[C3]  //  means we have done some change in c3
    feature=  C1----C2---C3----[C4]----[C5]  //means we done some new commit i.e C4 and C5
    
  step 2: # git merge feature master  //now we run merge command to merge the feature wto master
   master = C1----C2-----C4------C5-------[C3=C3] 
   
   step 3: # git rebase feature master // now re-arrang all commit or re-inedexing  
   master = C1----C2-----C3-------C4------C5
   --> remember , commit will be vanished on use of rebase command
